        Here are the steps that we recommend:
          * [Upgrade to the latest version of the SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/releases#specifying-the-version-of-the-text-editor-sdk) and check if the error still occurs.
          * Check the console in your browser's [developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#how_to_open_the_devtools_in_your_browser) for warnings and error messages. 
            * As of version `1.7.5` or later, some error codes may direct you to the [Error Explainer page](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/error-explainer) to view the complete message.
          * Check the Network tab in your browser's developer tools and filter by “grammarly” to see if any requests are being blocked.
          * Run `Grammarly.debug()` from the console and look for potential problems.
          * Run `Grammarly.printLogs(true)` from the console and look for potential problems.
