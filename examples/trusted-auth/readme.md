# Grammarly Trusted Authentication Configuration

This demo shows how to add an oauthAssertionProvider attribute to the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a `<textarea>` in a vanilla JavaScript app.

## Try the Demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/trusted-auth?file=/public/index.html).

## How it Works

[index.html](./public/index.html) contains a `<textarea>`. The example uses the [`oauthAssertionProvider` attribute](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/editor-sdk-intro#usage) to provide trusted auth assertions to the sdk.
