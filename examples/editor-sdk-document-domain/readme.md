# Grammarly Text Editor SDK with documentDomain

This demo shows how to add [documentDomain](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/editor-sdk/editorconfig#documentdomain) to  [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/).

## Try the Demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-document-domain?file=/public/index.html).

## How it Works

[index.html](./public/index.html) contains `div contenteditable>` elements. These elements are wrapped with the `<grammarly-editor-plugin>` tag so that Grammarly suggestions will be displayed in them. JavaScript code toward the bottom of the file configures the Grammarly Text Editor SDK. See [index.html](./public/index.html) for the full code example.
