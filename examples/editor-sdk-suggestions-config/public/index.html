    <h2>Suggestion Categories (Default)</h2>
    <p>
      When a writing suggestion category is set to "off", as is the case with the seven categories of suggestions that are muted with default settings, any suggestions belonging to that category will be muted (not visible to the user);
      however, if a user has connected their Grammarly account to your application, the full set of customized suggestions from their user profile will always take precedence (overriding these configurations).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Try the Grammarly Editor Plugin in the text area below!</strong>
      <p>In this example, writing suggestions for unnecessary ellipsis are turned "on".</p>
    </p>
    <grammarly-editor-plugin config.activation="immediate" config.suggestionCategories.unnecessaryEllipses="on">
      <div contenteditable="true">
        <p>
          Please bring me a pencil, eraser and notebook...
        </p>
      </div>
    </grammarly-editor-plugin>
    <p>
      Configuring and muting writing suggestion categories is available only on the Grammarly Text Editor SDK Plus plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explore these other pages to try configurations that mute different suggestion categories:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/suggestion-categories/oxford-comma.html">The Oxford comma</a> (<code>"oxfordComma"</code>)</li>
        <li><a href="/suggestion-categories/passive-voice.html">Passive voice</a> (<code>"passiveVoice"</code>)</li>
        <li><a href="/suggestion-categories/stylistic-fragments.html">Stylistic fragments</a> (<code>"stylisticFragments"</code>)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Default settings for Suggestion Categories</h2>
    <p>
      By default, the Grammarly Text Editor SDK mutes (turns "off") seven categories of writing suggestions.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conjunctions at the start of a sentence:</strong> Suggestions for using conjunctions such as "but" and "and" at the beginning of sentences (<code>"conjunctionAtStartOfSentence"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Prepositions at the end of a sentence:</strong> Suggestions for using prepositions such as "with" and "in" at the end of sentences (<code>"prepositionAtTheEndOfSentence"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Informal academic pronouns:</strong> Suggestions for using personal pronouns such as "I" and "you" in academic writing (<code>"informalPronounsAcademic"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>The Oxford comma:</strong> Suggestions for adding the Oxford comma after the second-to-last item in a list of things. (<code>"oxfordComma"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>The passive voice:</strong> Suggestions regarding use of the passive voice (<code>"passiveVoice"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Unnecessary ellipsis:</strong> Suggestions regarding unnecessary use of ellipses (...) (<code>"unnecessaryEllipses"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Stylistic fragments:</strong> Suggestions for completing all incomplete sentences, including stylistic sentence fragments that may be intentional (<code>"stylisticFragments"</code>).</li>
        </ul>
