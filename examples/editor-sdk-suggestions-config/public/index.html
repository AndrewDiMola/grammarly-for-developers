    <h2>Suggestion Categories (Default)</h2>
    <p>
      By default, the Grammarly Text Editor SDK mutes (turns "off") seven categories of writing suggestions.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conjunctions at the start of a sentence:</strong> Suggestions for using conjunctions such as "but" and "and" at the beginning of sentences (<code>"conjunctionAtStartOfSentence"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Prepositions at the end of a sentence:</strong> Suggestions for using prepositions such as "with" and "in" at the end of sentences (<code>"prepositionAtTheEndOfSentence"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Informal academic pronouns:</strong> Suggestions for using personal pronouns such as "I" and "you" in academic writing (<code>"informalPronounsAcademic"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>The Oxford comma:</strong> Suggestions for adding the Oxford comma after the second-to-last item in a list of things. (<code>"oxfordComma"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>The passive voice:</strong> Suggestions regarding use of the passive voice (<code>"passiveVoice"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Unnecessary Ellipsis:</strong> Suggestions regarding unnecessary use of ellipses (...) (<code>"unnecessaryEllipses"</code>).</li>
          <li><strong>Stylistic fragments:</strong> Suggestions for completing all incomplete sentences, including stylistic sentence fragments that may be intentional (<code>"stylisticFragments"</code>).</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      When a suggestion category is set to "off", as is the case with the above categories of suggestions with default settings, any suggestions belonging to that category will be muted (not visible to the user);
      however, if a user has connected their Grammarly account to your application, the full set of customized suggestions from their user profile will always take precedence.
