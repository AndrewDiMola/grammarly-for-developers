# Grammarly Text Editor SDK & React Example

This demo shows how to add the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a `<textarea>`, `<input>`, and elements with attribute `contenteditable="true"` in a React app. 

## How it works

[Editors.js](./src/Editors.js) contains a `<textarea>`, `<input>`, and `<div>` that is `contenteditable`, with each element wrapped with the `<GrammarlyEditorPlugin>` component. For rendering, [index.js](./src/index.js) specifies the Editors in [Editors.js](./src/Editors.js) that have text defined in [demo.js](./src/demo.js).

Learn additional ways to add Grammarly suggestions to React apps in the [Grammarly for Developers documentation](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/editor-sdk-react).
