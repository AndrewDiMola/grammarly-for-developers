# Grammarly Button Menu Position

This demo shows how to set the [menu position](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/editor-sdk/grammarlybuttonelement#menuposition) of the Grammarly button in the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/).

## Try the demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-menu-position?file=/public/index.html).

## How it works

[index.html](./public/index.html) and the other HTML files in this repository explicitly add the `<grammarly-button>` element to the page. The element includes the `menu-position` attribute, setting it to either `left` or `right`.

Unlike the other examples in this repo, we've centered the Grammarly button beneath the textarea. We chose this to demonstrate how you can set the menu position to the left or right of the button. Note that if there is not enough space for the menu to be displayed in the designated position, the menu will automatically be placed in a position where it will fit.

You can learn more about the `<grammarly-button>` element in the [Grammarly for Developers docs](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/customization#custom-position).
