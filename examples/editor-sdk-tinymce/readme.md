# Grammarly Text Editor SDK & TinyMCE Example

This demo shows how to add the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a [TinyMCE](https://www.tiny.cloud/) rich text editor.

## How it works

[index.html](./public/index.html) contains a `<textarea>` and a `<div>`. The `<textarea>` and `<div>` are each wrapped with the `<grammarly-editor-plugin>` tag, so that Grammarly suggestions will be displayed in those elements. JavaScript code toward the bottom of the file initializes TinyMCE on those elements and also configures the Grammarly Text Editor SDK.  See [index.html](./public/index.html) for the full code example.

Learn more about how to add Grammarly suggestions to rich text editors by visiting the [Grammarly for Developers documentation](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/#supported-text-editors).
