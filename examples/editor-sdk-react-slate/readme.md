# Grammarly Text Editor SDK & Slate Example (React)

This demo shows how to add the [Grammarly Text Editor SDK](https://developer.grammarly.com/) to a [Slate](https://docs.slatejs.org/) rich text editor in React.

## Try the Demo

You can try the demo in [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/grammarly/grammarly-for-developers/tree/main/examples/editor-sdk-react-slate?file=/src/Editor.js).

## How it Works

The `<GrammarlyEditorPlugin>` component wraps a Slate rich text editor in order to add Grammarly suggestions to it.  The `<Grammarly>` component wraps the `<GrammarlyEditorPlugin>` component and configures the Grammarly Text Editor SDK. See [Editor.js](./src/Editor.js) for the full code example.

Learn more about how to add Grammarly suggestions to rich text editors by visiting the [Grammarly for Developers documentation](https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/#supported-text-editors).
