# Grammarly for Developers Community Code of Conduct

Welcome to the Grammarly for Developers community! This is a dedicated space for developers to gather and collaborate around the Grammarly Text Editor SDK. As we continue to build other products on the Grammarly for Developers platform, we will look to our community for inspiration and feedback on making the experience outstanding for all! 

The primary purpose of the Grammarly for Developers community is to educate and inspire developers to use the platform's offerings. While our team will moderate all community spaces, we are building this community together and need your help to make it an inclusive and respectful environment for everyone. Because of this, we have a few ground rules we ask community members to follow.  

## Expected behavior

- **Be welcoming and accepting.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports everyone, regardless of their experience, education, race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, cultural background, or other defining characteristic.
- **Be respectful.** We may disagree and experience frustration, but let’s not allow that to turn into poor behavior or disrespect. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not productive. Community members should be civil and professional and should not post anything that might be considered offensive, abusive, or hate speech. 
- **Be considerate and empathetic.** We’re a worldwide community and company. Chances are you will interact with people from different backgrounds and perspectives. If you disagree with someone, try to understand where they may be coming from before addressing their comments. This will promote a welcoming atmosphere where people will feel comfortable asking questions and participating in discussions. 
- **Be clear and stay on topic.** This community is designed for developers to get the help they need as they work with Grammarly for Developers offerings. Off-topic comments can be a distraction—we encourage community members to stay on topic to help produce positive and productive discussions. 

## Prohibited behavior

- **Hate speech and discrimination.** We will not tolerate any speech which might be considered as sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory or offensive.
- **Bullying and harassment.** We will not tolerate any badgering or intimidation directed at a specific community member or members. 
- **Threats of violence.** You may not threaten violence toward others or use this community to incite, organize, or promote acts of violence. Think carefully about the words you use, the software you write, and any other information shared and how it may be interpreted by others. 
- **Disruptive behavior.** We will not tolerate behaviors that will continually disrupt the experience and conversation of others, such as posting off-topic questions or comments or raising meaningless issues. 

## Enforcement

- Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated. Words matter, and inappropriate speech may have consequences. 
- If a violation of this code of conduct occurs, Grammarly may take action, up to and including removal of members from the community. 
- If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [developers@grammarly.com](mailto:developers@grammarly.com).
